Project I am working on for my dad

Goals of this project is to complete the GUI, as this is the first time I have played around with a GUI in python it is taking longer than expected and I am sure there are better ways to go about this. I started it this way and I want to see it through. When I finsih my Masters degree I intend to focus on this project.
You need the sample.xlxs in order to understand or even run the program. 

Currently I know I need to close the windows after sumbit button is clicked and maybe add a confirmation that the submission was submited and the file was saved.
I do want to eliminate the Excel file entirely but I need to understand the math my dad was doing in his Excel file before I can do that. 

Next steps - correct GUI and bring visuals into the python program, so you do not have to run the program then open your saved excel file to view the stats or monte carlos
